        <h2>Indoor Exercises:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Forward Lunge</h3>
                A.
                Stand tall with feet hip-width apart. Place hands on hips or hold weights by sides to start.
                
                B.
                Take a controlled step forward with the right leg. Keeping spine tall, lower body until the front and back leg form a
                90-degree angle.
                
                C.
                Pause, then step right leg back to start. Step left leg forward to repeat on the other side.
                
                Sets:
                3
                
                Reps:
                10 per side
                
                Mistakes and Tips:
                There are many variations to the lunge, but the classic forward lunge is still very effective for weight loss, as it
                works multiple muscles at once (think: glutes, quads, and hamstrings).
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Burpee</h3>
                A.
                Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and arms at your sides. Push your hips back, bend knees, and reach palms to
                the ground to lower into a crouch.
                
                Immediately lower back into a squat for the next rep. Repeat 8 to 12 times. Complete 3 sets.
                
                B.
                With hands shoulder-width on the floor directly in front of feet, and shift your weight to them to jump back and land
                softly in plank position.
                
                C.
                Jump feet forward so they land just outside of hands. Jump explosively into the air, reaching hands overhead or leaving
                by sides.
                
                Sets:
                3
                
                Reps:
                8 to 12
                
                Mistakes and Tips:
                This exercise effectively targets your core, chest, and legs simultaneously. Feel the burn and know you're building lots
                of lean muscle.

                <h3>Explosive Lunge</h3>
                A.
                Start with feet together, hands on your hips. Step forward with the right leg and lower into a lunge so right knee is
                bent at a 90-degree angle.
                
                B.
                Jump up, switching legs midair.
                
                C.
                Land softly with the left leg forward, immediately lowering into a lunge.
                
                Sets:
                3
                
                Reps:
                Repeat for 1 minute
            </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Squat</h3>
                    A.
                    Start with feet hip-width apart, arms either at sides holding weights or clasped in front of chest.
                    
                    B.
                    Keeping weight in heels and back straight, sit hips back and bend knees to lower into a squat until thighs are parallel
                    to the floor. Remember to keep knees in line with toes the entire time. Maintain an even pace and rise back to start.
                    
                    Sets:
                    3
                    
                    Reps:
                    15
                    
                    Mistakes and Tips:
                    Squats are one of the best exercises for weight loss and for building overall strength. When you do them correctly, you
                    engage your core and entire lower body.

                    <h3>Jump Rope</h3>
                    A.
                    Start with feet together, hands holding ends of the jump rope, elbows in toward ribs. Swing the jump rope and step or
                    hop both feet over. Don't jump in between, just jump with each swing of the rope.
                    
                    Sets:
                    3
                    
                    Reps:
                    Repeat for 1 minute
                    
                    Mistakes and Tips:
                    Jumping rope is a great total-body tool made for weight loss. Challenge yourself to complete a full minute of
                    jumpingâ€”it's harder than you think.
                    
                    Check the length of the jump rope by holding it in each hands and ensuring the handles line up with shoulders.
